"""Building a training manifest out of MoeSpeech.

Everything here guards one property: the manifest must describe the audio
truthfully. A wrong `start` or `duration` does not raise -- it trains the model
on speech that does not match its text, and the only symptom is a model that
never quite becomes intelligible.
