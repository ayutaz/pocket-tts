"""Turn MoeSpeech's per-character zips into an aligned training manifest.

    python -m training.scripts.prepare_moespeech --hours 124 --out data/ja

MoeSpeech is 621 hours of 44.1 kHz Japanese character speech, published as one
zip per speaker with an ASR transcript, a duration and a speechMOS score beside
each clip. This script selects speakers, fetches only their zips, filters the
utterances on transcript agreement, concatenates each speaker's clips into
pseudo-long recordings, and runs forced alignment over the result.

Every stage skips work whose output already exists, and writes partial output
to a .partial file that is renamed on completion. The script is meant to run on
a preemptible cloud instance: being killed and re-run must always be safe.

    Completion is therefore recorded explicitly, as `<name>.complete` written

    callers can iterate it without filtering. A directory without that record
